# MyReads API

This API was build as an extension of the [MyReads App](https://github.com/colemanGH319/My-Reads), a React application built as part of the Udacity React Developer Nanodegree. The original API for the MyReads App was provided by Udacity, but I decided to replace it with my very own REST API created with Flask.

## Important
This API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](https://github.com/colemanGH319/My-Reads/blob/master/SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
